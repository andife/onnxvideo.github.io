This solution was deployed at the factory edge with an architecture that, using Kubernetes and Kafka, ensures a reliable and stable environment for productionized computer vision solutions complemented with a cloud-centralized infrastructure to monitor, manage and collect information from multiple factories&lt;/p&gt;
